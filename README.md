# Overview

This repository is my university dissertation project on e-learning with Large Language Models. The project is complete and no further changes will be made to this repository.


# Run the Code

Unfortunately, I cannot provide my own OpenAI API key, so the live LLM-usage features will result in errors. If you still want to try this project, clone it, make an account with OpenAI, generate your own API Key and insert it into /src/main/java/org/example/Llm.java in the field near the top that says "api-key" (it is commented for easy visibility).

After this, to actually run the program, you must have Maven installed and Java version 21 or higher. Navigate to the root directory and run `mvn javafx:run`. This should open the GUI and you can start playing with the program.

If you have any problems, feel free to contact me.
